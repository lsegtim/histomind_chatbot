- - What is Arankale Buddhist Monastery?
  - Arankale Monastery is a 6th-century cave hermitage located up a forested hillside in Sri Lanka, about 24 kilometers away from the Kurunegala town, along the Kubukwewa-Madalanda road. Initially, it served as the austere abode for a sect of recluse monks, who were drawn to the site due to its isolation. Today, although in ruins, the monastery is a protected archaeological site and is ideal for architecture and archaeology enthusiasts

- - What is the historical significance of Arankale Buddhist Monastery?
  - The monastery was associated with the Pansakulika sect of monks, who wore robes made from rags as a vow of austerity. The name Arankale is likely derived from "arahan," an enlightened one, and "kale," a forest. The monastery's ancient name and much of its early history remain unknown. However, it's known that King Jethatissa improved upon the monastery, choosing the forest land surrounding it for its security, amidst the ancient Dolukanda, Dunkanda, and Madukanda mountains

- - What architectural features are notable at Arankale Buddhist Monastery?
  - Among the ruins, you'll find double platform buildings unique to the padhanaghara pirivenas of the Pansakulika monks. These platforms are formed by massive stone retaining walls, linked by a stone bridge, with access provided by two short flights of steps. These buildings were surrounded by water troughs to keep the interior cool. Other notable ruins include a Jantagara or hot water bath, meditating promenades, ponds, winding pathways, and paved ambulatories for meditation walks. At the entrance, there's a building identified as a hot water bath, and one of the three ancient bathing ponds has been completely restored
